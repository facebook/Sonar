The Sandbox plugin is useful for developers that had to test changes of their apps by pointing them to some Sandbox environment. Through this plugin and a few lines of code in the client,
the app can get a callback and get the value that the user has input through Flipper. At this point, the developer can plugin its logic to save this setting in its app.
